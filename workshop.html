					This was the first workshop practice that we had in this course, which simulated the process of preparing and presenting a project proposal to a client in order to win the bidding process. The aim of this workshop was to understand the process of preparing and presenting a project proposal, and the meeting that is held before the bidding process from the perspective of the client, and from the perspective of the firm that is entering to a tender. Some of the most important aspects of this workshop practice included; understanding the effect that different design proposals have on the prepared project proposals, the way that a firm should present their proposals in the meeting and as a firm to be prepared for all the questions that the client might ask during the meeting and the presentation.  
					<p >
					In order to create a challenging environment; a group of us was became the client firm, while the rest of us divided into two groups to work on two different design scenarios for the same project. While one of the groups prepared a design proposal for a low-rise building for the project, the other group had prepared a design proposal of a high-rise building design for the same project. Each group had architectural partners, cost & value engineers and sustainability consultants, and each person had to prepare their part of the proposal.  The aim was to understand how the design proposal affected the document that was being prepared for the proposal.  In the end both proposals had the same content titles but their context were totally different each other because their approaches, design considerations, and ideas were different.
					</p>
					<p>
					As A+I Partners our firm was assigned for the high-rise building scenario. Our proposal elaborated on the advantages that a high-rise building design will have on the project, its benefits for the client in terms of function, cost and sustainability. So as a team we were basically trying to convince the client to choose our design for the project based on the facts that we have listed in our proposal.

					The aim of this workshop practice is to simulate the pre-project phases in an architectural project, in order to understand the entire process and its importance to the rest of the phases in the project. Each group is assigned to work with a different project scenario that requires different pre-project phase preparations.  These scenarios vary according to their function, scale and location but the important thing is to understand how these variations effect the documents that are prepared. All groups are expected to develop alternative project proposals based on their scenarios. These scenarios include; Ankara Office Complex (with only architecture project services), Bingöl Shopping Center (both architecture and engineering services), İstanbul Museum (all project disciplines’ services), Ankara Villa (architecture/engineering services), Kazakhstan MXD Masterplan (masterplan design and concept design services), Dubai Residence (Concept design and design development services), and Istanbul Greater Municipality City Management Center (concept design and detailed design services). 
					<p >
					We are expected to prepare a pre-project proposal for the scenario of the project that we are assigned to. Our group was assigned to Bingöl Shopping Center project which was a relatively large-scaled, commercial project, and our firm was to provide only architecture services. Our pre-project proposal for the client; which was Bingöl Municipality included; information about our firm, our design approach, members of the team involved in the project, our design proposal with all the required data and documents, milestones that we have set for project, pricing and the schedule that we have planned for the project.
					</p>
					<p >
					This workshop showed us the importance and the depth of the information that should be put into a pre-project proposal. Since it is a “pre-proposal” it shouldn’t have all the details and visuals prepared for the project, but there should be sufficient information about the design to able to communicate well with the client. There should also be sample works from the firm’s previous projects to give the client an idea about the firm’s architectural approach.
