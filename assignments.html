The meaning of architecture can change from person to person depending on their experiences, backgrounds, culture, emotions, ideologies, motivations, expectations, educations, professions…. etc. 
As a soon-to-be architect the meaning of architecture for me is very deep and complex. Depending on my current mood, emotions and thoughts this definition can vary from time to time. Sometimes I see it as the medium, as a tool that combines art and science to create unique products. On the other hand, sometimes, I see it as a time machine that can physically and mentally take you from the present all the way to the past or to the future. But I know that architecture is a product of many factors; aesthetics, psychology, sociology, function, structure, environmental conditions, urban environment...etc.  “Good architecture” for me is when the end product initiates and evokes a certain thought or emotion on the people. It’s the physical form of life produced by innovation, experimentation and imagination. 
The power of architecture should never be undermined because it is used to creates and shapes the environments that we live in, it gives a unique identity to a place. It has the power to control human behavior and psychology. It can be used to protect and preserve habitats, fauna and flora. 
Architecture as a profession, and its education can sometimes be really stressful and dramatic, at those times the meaning of architecture becomes something dark; it evokes feeling like perfectionism, uncertainty, time management, precision, endless trials etc.</p>

The format and layout should be flexible enough to use its variations for each event, lecture, workshop…etc. This assignment thought us how to prepare a design layout that is flexible enough to be used as a template for course events, seminars and lectures. While aesthetics is an important aspect of design, flexibility and compatibility are also important factors to consider.  The content was already provided to use; which was the summary of the syllabus and the original course content, however the challenge was to determine the length of this text and how to represent it in the poster.  
Since this was the product of a team work, we first identified what this course “ARCH 418 Professional Practice” meant to and our expectations from this course. We tried to show these visually with different images and renderings.</p>

Goal was to create a logo, business card and A4 letter document that will reflect our own architectural profession as an identity and our own approach to architecture. The logo that we have created was going to represent our firm’s definition of architecture, our approach to architecture, the projects that we do, the style and taste that we have...etc. Therefore, its design and how it is used in different documents such as A4 letter documents, business cards and related architectural documents are all factors that we should bear in mind while designing our logo. 
A logo is more than a symbol it is the visual expression of a firm’s identity. It is an efficient way to communicate information about our business, it identifies the firm and helps people to differentiate the firm from other businesses, it has a great impact on the firm’s pubic perception. The size, design and format are all up to the designer, and are created according to their own approach to the business.

An assignment teaching the importance of project brief; what its contents are, how it is prepared and organized and most importantly how it should be presented.
 A project brief is a document that outlines a summary of the project ideas and features. Most of the time, it highlights all of the milestones that the design team has set for the project, and shows all the work that needs to be done. It should define the client’s requirements for the project and for the development of the built asset. The prepared project brief should have; a description of the client,
 information related to the context and project site (clear information about the location, spatial conditions, constraints of the site, spatial requirements), program details (all of the main spaces that will be designed including the servicing, served and technical areas should be specified), members of the team that will be involved in the project, miles stones for the project, the stages of project execution, estimated time period for each stage…etc.

After graduation there are lots of different paths that fresh architect can choose to follow. These paths include; continuing your education and pursuing a master’s degree, becoming an academician, finding a job in a corporate firm/office, becoming a project architect, working in the construction field, starting your own company, becoming a freelance worker, or any other suitable path. But now is the time to start planning our road map for the next five years after our graduation. 
This assignment helped me to gather all my thoughts and ideas about the future. I was able reflect on these ideas which helped me to determine what to actually do in the next five years. I have created a road map that shows what I want to start with after graduation and continue with throughout these years. Since there are lots of different options; creating such a plan and schedule motivated and made the future a bit more clear for me.
