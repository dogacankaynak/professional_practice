								This discussion shows the alternative paths that can be chosen to start your career once you complete your bachelor’s degree in architecture. Studying architecture can open many doors; you can choose to become a licensed architect, or choose to continue in an entirely different path. You can choose to work in careers related with art and history, technology and community development, education and many more.
								</p>
								<p class="text-muted mb-0"><spacep>
								For the ones who would like to pursue a career in architecture; they must search for ways to find project and business potentials, which might be through the market, by creating strong networks with other designers and architects, by participating in competitions in different scales (which can be local, national or international competitions), by building up your reputation in the profession. While finding potential businesses it is essential for an architect to participate in events related with architecture and design, so that they can meet with other people from the same profession or similar professions. Such environments are filled with possible job opportunities therefore participation to these kinds of events is highly important.

								<p class="text-muted mb-0"><spacep>This discussion explained the potential stakeholders in the architecture profession which are referred to as “Major Stakeholders”; their importance and role in the entire project development and application phases. These potential stakeholders included; the clients, designers, project team, workers, instructors and students. Types of clients that architects work with can vary depending on establishment and on focus. In terms of establishment it can be a private firm, the government, commercial or a combination and in terms of focus it can be an individual who is a developer, an investor, a consultant, landowner or even finance. 
								One of the main scopes of this lecture was to understand the “entire project design” process, that should always be perceived as a “total organization and a process management issue”.  We also discussed the general circumstances and problems that architects and designers often face in their professional practice.

								<p class="text-muted mb-0"><spacep>This discussion explained the potential “Secondary/Other Stakeholders” in the architecture practice; their importance, their stakes, the opportunities that they present, their challenges or threats to the project, their responsibilities, and strategies or actions that can be used and made to engage with these stakeholders. Secondary stakeholders include public, agents, chambers, associations, NGOs (which could be political, social or other), environmentalists, competitors, consumer groups, tourists, media and many more. These stakeholders often have an indirect relationship with the company but they can still be influential towards the company and the project.
								</p>
								<p class="text-muted mb-0"><spacep>
								According to the type of client the project development phases can change; their involvement, their roles, their effect, their engagement can all change. Architects Association (in Turkey), RIBA (Royal Institute of British Architects in UK), AIA (American Institute of Architects in US), TSMD (Türk Serbest Mimarlar Derneği in Turkey), RAIC (Royal Architectural Institution in Canada), BDA are architectural associations in various countries; their role and involvement may change from country to country. The American Institute of Architects(AIA), Architects/Designers/Planners for Social Responsibilities (ADPSR), UKUMBI are all examples to NGOs that are responsibile from architectural works in various different countries.

								Developing and building an architectural project consists of three main stages; pre-project phase, project (execution) phase and lastly the post project phase. Pre-project phase include; meetings, research studies, analysis, feasibility reports, design approach reports, proposals, negotiations and ends with the awarding, which is where the client chooses a firm to do the project. Next stage is the project/design stage which is where the actual project development begins, this phase includes the delivery methods, involvement of the majority of the team, its stages are; pre-design, schematic design, design development, construction documentation, bidding/construction/commissioning, building operations and lastly post-occupancy.
								</p>
								<p class="text-muted mb-0"><spacep>
								This discussion focuses on the “project delivery methods” which is part of the second; project phase. Project delivery method is a comprehensive process that includes planning of the project, design of the project and its construction that is required to execute and compete a building facility. Choosing the proper and most efficient project delivery method is one of the most important steps of this phase, because this method determines the strategy that will be used by the entire project team to communicate with one another. There are 4 main project delivery methods; design-bid-build, construction management at risk, design-build and integrated project delivery, it is up to the owner to determine the best method for the project.

								This discussion highlights the advantages and disadvantages of staying in academia after pursuing a bachelor’s degree in architecture. After graduating, before deciding on your future plans it is important to consider and get to know all the possible things you can do with your life and career. Staying in academia and becoming a researcher or an instructor/professor are some of these options that we have. It is important to understand the role of architecture in the academic world and how it differentiates from architecture as a practice. 
								</p>
								<p class="text-muted mb-0"><spacep>
								Design and architecture are a wide field that requires a great amount of practice, experience based on learning and performing. The way architecture proceeds in academic world is entirely different from the way it proceeds in professional world. The advantages of staying in academia include; it is open to personal development, ease of international interactions, tolerable working schedule and ease for reaching resources. While disadvantages include; not being active in the field, getting too deep into theoretical facts and knowledge might become an obstacle in creative thinking and unfortunately it might also not have a very good salary.

								In this discussion we talked about the importance and impact of architectural design competitions on the architectural industry, which helps people to push their boundaries and gain more experience in design, critical thinking, time management and presentation. Participating in an architectural competition is often a good experience to have, and may help individuals with their future careers.
							</p>
							<p class="text-muted mb-0"><spacep>
							Competitions vary from context, scale, function, user profile, design approach and in some cases, participation might be limited. designers and architects; some of them are open to everyone, while some can be limited to students only, and some can be limited to only experienced professionals. 
							</p>
							<p class="text-muted mb-0"><spacep>
							The goal in most of the competitions is to help people improve their architectural expression and presentation techniques while meeting with their colleagues. Awards are an important part of the competitions; they are the best way to encourage and motivate individuals to compete with one another and to push them to think outside of the box. When students enter to competitions; they get the chance to push their boundaries, meet with other people, improve themselves in their presentation skills which is important when preparing a portfolio.  For professionals, competitions allow an environment to freely express their ideas, while improving their reputation and increasing their networks.
