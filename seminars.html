					The Ministry of Environment and Urbanization has a significant role in the design and development of both the urban environments and the built environments. Their major function is to set standards law and regulations related to environmental issues, to create masterplans for urban projects, to control and participate in the process of repair and/or renovation projects, to determine the contract specifications, to create annual unit prices, consider and apply the climate change in all kinds of projects, and to determine general policies. Government’s involvement in projects may change according to the type and scale of project; they can be directly involved in the design of ministry buildings, embassy buildings, education buildings, health facilities, social facilities, parks…etc. 
					<p >
					She received her Bachelor’s Degree in architecture from METU in 1992. Worked in architectural offices and construction companies after graduation. From 1997 she has been working in the Ministry of Environmental and Urbanization in preparation and supervision of the architectural projects of the public buildings, such as Ministry buildings, justice buildings, Embassy buildings. She also worked as a jury member of architectural competitions. She worked in energy efficiency in buildings and was responsible from the Energy Performance of Buildings Legislation and National Green Building Legislation. She got part in international technical assistance projects. At the moment she is working as a Department Manager and Project Director of the World Bank financed “Energy Efficiency in Public Buildings Project”.

						Architecture is not only about building functions and shape but also the company and
						the architect needs to consider economy, environment, employees and so on. Designs need to be based on the financial status of the investor and while doing current economy needs to be followed. Work environment is crucial for the outcome of the project and also for productive employees. The relation between team members and with their superiors is important because all disconnections and disagreements among the team affect the project process. Therefore, architectural company is more complex and deep than it seems.
						Architectural process and work is not for one person, it is teamwork and there should be collaboration among the team. The project has phases and each phases done by different people with different specialists.					
						<p >
					There are 3 different steps through the process which are concept phase, application phase and the construction phase. As a start, the solid data of the site is very important. The recent regulations are important, too. The design must be done taking into consideration all these regulations. Working as team and constantly working develop the project. Showing other member of team who do not know the project gives another perspective.

						Green building in architecture is the practice of designing and building structures that are sensitive and responsive to environmental conditions, meaning that they are environmentally responsible and resource-efficient throughout the building’s life span and life cycle which starts from its design process, continues with the construction, operation, maintenance, renovation/repair and even deconstruction phases. There are certification systems that controls and validates these green buildings, since built environment in general has an extensive direct and indirect impact on its environment. These certification systems include; green building standards, certifications and rating systems that aims at minimizing the impact of the built structure on the natural environment that it is situated in through the use of sustainable design approaches. Building Research Establishment’s Environmental Assembly Method (BREEAM), Green Building Council (USGBC), Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) are examples to some of these rating systems for new construction.

							This seminar will give an overview of construction management and introduce a new framework for re-organizing and using the “traditional” project management tool-kit. The framework is based on an interpretive analysis of 26 “stories" of project management in Turkey and around the world. The first author Selçuk Alten will illustrate the main concepts by chronicling these stories. The discussion will also include short histories (and critiques) of the sector in Turkey and of project management globally; the importance of design management and role of design thinking in project management; recommendations for legislation and rules governing the sector; and for project management
							as part of higher education.						
							<p >
							Talked about the importance of having on site experience, how “getting your hands dirty” on site is one of the most influential and important experiences that an architect can have throughout his/her carrer to understand the core of architecture as a discipline.

							Recieved his PhD from Middle East Technical University in 2017. His research interests include theory of architecture and urbanism, urban design, mapping, data mining and visualization. He is currently teaching design studios and drafting courses. His interests are critical cartograpghy, theory and history of architectural and urban design, epistemology of design and pedagogical  practises of architecture and urban design. He has been conducting research, teaching and practicing  in these fields. He has a numbers of prizes in architectural and urban design competitions. He has  assisted and contributed to many desing and theory courses for undergraduate students. He also has contributed to the making of Ankara Urban Atlas which is a collection of ingenious maps and critical  studies of urban spaces of the capital city of Turkey. He has publications on pedagogical aspects of  design education and urban design theory. His PhD study Atlas of Urban Design, Technical Analysis  and Mapping of Production of Knowledge in Turkish Context, presents anepistemological mapping of  the development and state of urban design knowledge in Turkish academia.The study was concluded  in 2017. He was also a part of a research project on the epistemic bases of doctoral research on  Architecture in Turkey. He is currently working at ID. Bilkent University as an Instructor teaching  senior year design studios as well as courses on visualization at different grades.
							<p >
							This lecture focused on the possible roads that a newly graduate architect can choose to pursue; which might be achieving a master degree, continuing in the academia, working as a freelance, working in a corporate/office, starting your own business, or any other possible road. 
						</p>
						<p >
							There are lots of architecture and design competitions that we can enter, which will have a positive impact on our future plans. The experience you get when you join a competition, whether individually or as a team is very important, because it is a completely different format than both education and real-work. Some of the competitions that we can enter while being a student or as a graduate include; TAK (Tasarım Araştrıma Katılım), ARCHIWORLD Academy, KMKD, Aura and many more.
